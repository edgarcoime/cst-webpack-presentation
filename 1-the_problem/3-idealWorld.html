<!-- Ideal scenario -->
<script>
  var $ = require('jquery')
  var foo = require('./js/foo')
  var bar = require('./js/bar')
  var foobar = require('./js/foobar')

  // Doesn't work out like this, `require` is a synchronous request
  //   - So if file that we require hasn't been loaded in some way we need to HTTP request
  //   - But that is asynchronous 
  // Solution:
  //   - put all dependencies in one file to have all code in memory, ready to be used when invoking require() function
